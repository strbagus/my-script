# Sync File Script
*Case:* I have folder with all of my notes, i want share some my notes to my team. but i don't want to share whole folder. I create new folder with my shared notes in it. I need update my notes in shared folder, so i need sync only notes that exists on both folder.

---

*Next:* It only one way sync (My main folder into share folder). I want make two way sync. Since i using Obsidian.md as text editor for markdown, the note file modified date is not updated when i update it content so i need figure out another way to check which files is has latest changes.
